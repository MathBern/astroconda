This repository provides tools and utilities commonly used by the astronomical community.

The components provided through the `astroconda <http://anaconda.org/astroconda>`_ channel on `anaconda.org <http://anaconda.org>`_
include most of the tools the user needs to work with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data and data from other telescopes in
a single Anaconda Python environment.  Each of the components contains sets of packages which have also been built and tested
to insure that they work with each other in the same environment.

Support for use of the STScI-developed software included in the astroconda channel on `anaconda.org <http://anaconda.org>`_
will be provided by STScI by emailing `help@stsci.edu <mailto:help@stsci.edu>`_.
